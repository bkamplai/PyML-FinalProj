## Title: ASL Alphabet Classifier

### Abstract (Draft):
This project will utilize a dataset of images containing ASL signs for each letter of the alphabet in order to create a model to classify signs from images, videos, and live feeds. This will also feature a (desktop/web?) application that will allow users to upload an image, video, or use the webcam to do signs and receive output of what the model classifies their signs as.
